                    React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design
                    simple views for each state in your application, and React
                    will efficiently update and render just the right components
                    when your data changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier
                    to debug.

                    Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,

                    Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of
                    templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app
                    and keep state out of the&nbsp;DOM.

                    We donâ€™t make assumptions about the rest of your technology

                    rewriting existing code.
